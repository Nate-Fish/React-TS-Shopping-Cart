# React-TS-Shopping-Cart
## Intro
This is a basic mock ecommerce website with a shopping cart, navbar, sidebar, webhooks, and more. I will be some additional functionality such as account creation, the ability to "pay" for products, and reviews. In addition, I am using bootstrap to tweak the aesthetics of the website.

2 - Open up your cloned repository's directory and type npm install to download all dependencies (REACT)

3 - Run `npm run dev` in your terminal

## Status
